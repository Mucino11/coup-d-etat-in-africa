      <h2>Coup attempts in Africa</h2>
      <p>
        In recent years these leaders have overturn the government in their
        respective home countries, even though their motivations might be
        different but the common denominators in most of the recent coup is
        France.

          Many of these countries were once colonies of France during the
          colonial era, and the Republic of Guinea's government under Alpha
          Condé was ousted by Mamady Doumbouya, a former French Legionnaire who
          held the rank of corporal.

        <h2>Uranium</h2>

        <p>
          For instance, France was acquiring uranium from Canada at a cost of
          ¢200 per kilogram, while simultaneously procuring uranium from Niger
          for approximately ¢0.80 per kilogram. This stark contrast in pricing
          left many Nigeriens feeling that the arrangement was highly
          inequitable and, to some extent, exploitative.

          France presence in Mali may have led to more violence in the country
          according to the Harvard International Review. The intention of the
          French might have been good but their execution or their approach to
          conflict resolution was totally flawed, since they left Mali in more
          ciaos then before they arrived in the country.

      <h2>The motivations behind the coups</h2>
      <p>
        Delving further into the motivations driving these coups, it becomes
        clear that France's economic interests hold a central position.
        Mineral-rich regions like Niger with its uranium, Gabon with its crude
        oil, and Guinea with its bauxite reserves, serve as significant sources
        of economic influence for France. This economic interdependence
        establishes a fragile equilibrium, and any alteration in power dynamics
        can precipitate political instability.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          In conclusion, many of the recent coups in Africa can be traced back
          to a prevailing anti-French sentiment among the inhabitants of
          Francophone nations. A significant portion of the population feels
          that France has exploited them for an extended period, prompting a
          desire for change. This sentiment often translates into a desire to
          oust governments aligned with France.
        </p>
        <p>
          While some coup leaders genuinely seek changes that would benefit
          their people, others may exploit this anti-French sentiment as a
          pretext to seize power and perpetuate the existing status quo.
